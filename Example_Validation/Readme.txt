Pitfalls and Limitations
--------------------------
At SelfServicing example at frmCustomers and frmOrders, if you set an invalid value to a control 
(say control A), an error icon is shown and the control value keeps
the invalid one. Then you go to another field control (say B) and set some value, when you do that, 
the value of A is reset to the original value and the error icon is still there (valid value and error 
icon). This is a flaw of the IDataErrorInfo + ErrorProviders. The example expects that the user (as 
users used to) see an error icon and fixed it, then go to another field control. If that flow is used, 
everything will work, if not, you should add especial code at your GUI to call some routine that reset 
IDataErrorInfo of the "valid fields". You can read more about this discussion here:
